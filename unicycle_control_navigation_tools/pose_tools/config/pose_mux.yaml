# Input topics handled/muxed.
# For each topic:
# - name    : name identifier to select the topic
# - topic   : input topic of geometry_msgs::Twist type
# - timeout : timeout in seconds to start discarding old messages, and use 0.0 speed instead
# - priority: priority in the range [0, 255]; the higher the more priority over other topics

topics:
-
    name    : joypad
    topic   : pose_joy
    timeout : 0.5
    priority: 100
-
    name    : keyboard
    topic   : pose_key
    timeout : 0.5
    priority: 20
-
    name    : control
    topic   : pose_ctrl
    timeout : 0.5
    priority: 10
    
# Locks to stop the ackermann inputs.
# For each lock:
# - name    : name identifier to select the topic
# - topic   : input topic that provides the lock; it must be of type std_msgs::Bool
# - timeout : == 0.0 -> not used
#              > 0.0 -> the lock is supposed to published at a certain frequency in order
#                       to detect that the publisher is alive; the timeout in seconds allows
#                       to detect that, and if the publisher dies, then the lock is enabled
# - priority: priority in the range [0, 255], so all the topics with priority lower than it
#             are stopped/disabled

locks:
-
  name    : pause
  topic   : /pause_motion
  timeout : 0.5
  priority: 100
